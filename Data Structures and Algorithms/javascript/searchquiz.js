//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
    // bfs
//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
    // bfs (dfs will take long)
//If the tree is very wide:
    // dfs (bfs will need too much memory)
//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
    // dfs
//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
    // dfs
//Finding the shortest path:
    // bfs
